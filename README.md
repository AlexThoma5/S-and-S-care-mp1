## Design & Planning:

### User Stories

1. As an elderly person, I want to be able to easily find information about the types of care services provided, so I can understand if the company meets my needs.
2. As a new site user, I need easy navigation and a user-friendly design, including a responsive layout for my device, so I can find information quickly and efficiently without frustration.
3. As an elderly client, I want a straightforward way to request a callback from the care team, so I can ask questions or get more information at a convenient time.
4. As an elderly person, I want to easily find contact information like phone numbers and email addresses, so I can quickly reach out for assistance when needed.
5. As a family member, I want to see pictures of the caregivers in action, so I can visualise the care environment and interactions.
6. As a family member, I want to be able to see testimonials from other families so that I trust the care provided for my loved one.
7. As a new customer, I want to know what locations these services are offered in, so I don’t waste time enquiring if it’s not in my area.
8. As an elderly client, I want to see what kinds of social activities or companionship services are available, so I can stay engaged and avoid feeling lonely.

### Wireframes

The wireframes for this website were created using Balsamiq to establish a clear and intuitive structure. I followed the mobile-first approach ensuring my site is optimised and responsive across all devices.

### Typography

When selecting the fonts for my website, I considered readability, aesthetics and brand identity. Therefore I chose the following fonts:

#### Primary Font - Roboto

  - Used for all text, besides headings.
  - Clean, modern, and highly legible, especially good for mobile views.


  #### Secondary Font - Raleway

  - Used for all headings across the site.
  - Modern, simple and highly readable.

### Colour Scheme

When deciding on a colour scheme, I wanted the continue the modern, professional and highly readable guidelines I previously set for myself. In doing so these are the colours I decided upon.

![Colour Pallette](docs/screenshots/colors.png)

I chose the colour "Raisin Black" as my primary colour. I thought it provided a professional look while complimenting the colours of the company logo in the navigation bar.

The background color of my website is "Seasalt". This neutral colour contrasts very well with the primary colour and helps the white space around the text stand out more. For a clean, uncluttered look.

The main highlight colour "Celestial Blue" is used for many subheadings across the site. This helps the headings be clear and visible to the user. This shade of blue is similar to uniforms worn by caregivers and the colours of the S&S Care logo. This helps create a feeling of familiarity for the user as they navigate the website.

The final highlight colour is "Red Violet". This is used on all call-to-action buttons across the site. This vibrant colour stands out very well amongst the other colours of the site, directing the user's attention to the most important features of the site.
